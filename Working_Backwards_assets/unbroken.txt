Unbroken Ensures Logistics Continuity During Disasters
Because logistics should not stop, even when everything else does

Stockholm, Sweden - November 15, 2025 - Chaos Coders announced the release of Unbroken - its disaster-resilient logistics tracker designed for logistics operations managers in private and public sector organizations, ensuring continuity of essential logistics operations during catastrophic events. In times of disruption such as earthquakes or extreme weather, managers can utilize Unbroken to maintain visibility and coordination across logistics handoffs, even without internet connectivity. The lightweight mobile app allows users to scan items, log their condition, and sync data once connectivity is restored, preventing major disruptions and potential revenue loss due to delays and lost items. Unbroken is now available to logistics operations teams in healthcare, food supply chains, and other essential services.
Logistics operations managers in medium to large-scale organizations are increasingly confronted with the reality that disruptions caused by catastrophic events can lead to significant operational challenges. During such crises, the lack of visibility and coordination can result in potential revenue losses of up to 15% annually. These disruptions are not just financially damaging; they jeopardize the timely provision of critical goods and services, particularly in sectors like healthcare and food supply chains, where delays can have dire consequences. Furthermore, companies report that as much as 70% of their logistics operations are adversely affected when connectivity is lost, underscoring the urgent need for reliable tracking and management solutions in these high-stakes environments.
Unbroken addresses the critical challenge of maintaining logistics continuity during disasters by offering a reliable logistics tracking solution that operates seamlessly, even without internet connectivity. This innovative mobile app allows logistics operations managers to scan items, record essential data such as location and condition, and update package statuses in real-time, ensuring visibility and communication across multiple handoffs. With Unbroken, users can confidently navigate disruptions, knowing that all collected data will automatically sync once connectivity is restored. By empowering logistics teams to manage their operations effectively during emergencies, Unbroken transforms crisis management into a streamlined and controlled process.
"Unbroken is more than just a logistics tracker; it's a lifeline for operations that need to keep moving even in the toughest times. We've heard directly from logistics managers about their struggles during catastrophic events, and this solution directly addresses those pain points, ensuring they can maintain essential services without disruption. Our vision is for organizations to stay resilient and deliver critical goods - because logistics should not stop, even if the world does," said Kasja Grip, Chief Operations Officer at Chaos Coders.
When disaster strikes, the logistics operations manager opens the "Unbroken" app on their smartphone, immediately greeted by a clear dashboard showing all active logistics nodes, even without internet connectivity. Next, they easily scan items using their device’s camera or RFID reader, quickly logging each item's condition and location. Then, they can update the status of shipments with just a few taps, allowing them to maintain real-time visibility across their operations. As they work, they feel confident knowing that all data will automatically sync once the network is restored, providing a reliable trail of custody. This straightforward process helps them coordinate effectively with their teams, ensuring essential goods and services reach their destinations on time, ultimately transforming their crisis management into a seamless operation.
"Before we started using Unbroken, keeping track of our shipments during a storm was a complete nightmare; we lost thousands because we couldn't release items when the internet went down," said Anna Karlsson, 42, a logistics manager from Getinge. "After we started using Unbroken, our teams can continue to deliver the critical equipment to hospitals and emergency units - at the time when the need it most. Now, even when the networks are out, I can update shipments without missing a beat. Just last week, when we had compete power outage for 16 hours, I managed to log the condition of our supplies and ensure they got to the hospital on time, and everything synced back perfectly afterwards. This has completely transformed our operation; I feel we can handle crises rather than just react to them. I’ve been telling everyone in my network about it - this is a must-have for any logistics team!"
