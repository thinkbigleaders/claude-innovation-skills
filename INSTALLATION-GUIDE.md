## Usage: The Complete Flow

### Phase 1: customer-discovery

**When to use:**
- Starting a new innovation project
- Validating a problem/opportunity
- Need to understand customer needs deeply

**How to start:**
```
I'm exploring [problem space/opportunity].
Help me do customer-discovery to understand the customer needs.
```

**What Claude will do:**
1. Guide you through Jobs-to-be-Done analysis
2. Create a globally diverse persona with cultural context
3. Help you gather and synthesize evidence

**Output:** Complete customer understanding document with JTBD, persona, and evidence

**Time:** 1-2 hours with Claude's guidance

---

### Phase 2: solution-definition

**When to use:**
- After completing customer-discovery
- Ready to define what you'll build
- Need to align team on solution vision

**How to start:**
```
I've completed customer-discovery for [problem space].
[Paste or reference the customer-discovery output]

Now help me do solution-definition using Working Backwards and Closed World.
```

**What Claude will do:**
1. Help you write a compelling PRFAQ (press release + FAQ)
2. Map the Closed World components of your solution
3. Identify relationships and innovation opportunities

**Output:** Complete solution vision (PRFAQ) + resource inventory (Closed World)

**Time:** 1-2 hours with Claude's guidance

---

## Example Prompts

### Starting customer-discovery

**Prompt 1 (from scratch):**
```
I want to understand the needs of small business owners in Southeast Asia 
who struggle with managing distributed teams. Help me do customer-discovery.
```

**Prompt 2 (with context):**
```
I'm exploring the problem of unreliable electricity in rural areas of developing 
countries. I've done some initial research but need structured customer-discovery. 
Help me with JTBD, persona (make sure it's globally diverse), and evidence gathering.
```

---

### Moving to solution-definition

**After customer-discovery is complete:**

```
Great! Now I have a clear understanding of the customer needs. Let's move to 
solution-definition. Help me write a Working Backwards PRFAQ for a solution 
that addresses these needs, then map the Closed World.
```

**With PRFAQ drafted:**
```
I've written a draft PRFAQ for my solution. Can you review it using the Working 
Backwards framework and help me refine it? Then we'll map the Closed World.

[Paste draft PRFAQ]
```

---

## Key Reminders

### For customer-discovery:

✅ **Always request global diversity:** "Create a globally diverse persona, not US-focused"  
✅ **Allocate 3-5 hours for evidence gathering:** Don't skip this step  
✅ **Use persona voice:** Customer quotes should sound authentic

### For solution-definition:

✅ **PRFAQ first, then Closed World:** Don't map components until vision is clear  
✅ **Iterate the PRFAQ 3-5 times:** First draft is never good enough  
✅ **Be honest in FAQ:** If hard problems are unsolvable, better to know now

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Skill isn't activating**  
A: Explicitly say "Use the customer-discovery skill" or "Use the solution-definition skill"

**Q: Persona is too Western/US-focused**  
A: Say "Create a globally diverse persona - choose a region outside North America/Europe"

**Q: Not getting evidence gathering**  
A: Say "Help me with evidence gathering step using social media, market research, etc."

**Q: PRFAQ feels like feature list**  
A: Say "Focus on customer benefits and experience, not technical features"

**Q: Closed World has too many/few components**  
A: Aim for 8-15 internal, 5-10 external. Say "Let's refine the component list"

## Next Steps After Both Skills

Once you have:
- ✅ Customer understanding (JTBD, persona, evidence)
- ✅ Solution vision (PRFAQ)
- ✅ Resource inventory (Closed World)

You're ready for:
- **Ideation:** Generate innovative ideas using SCAMPER (next skill to build)
- **Evaluation:** Rate and select best ideas
- **Validation:** Deep-dive with Six Hats thinking
- **Technical problem-solving:** TRIZ for hard challenges
