# Evidence Gathering Framework

## Purpose

After understanding customer jobs and creating personas, gather evidence from the real world to:
- Validate assumptions about customer needs
- Discover what solutions already exist
- Identify gaps and opportunities
- Understand competitive landscape
- Find patterns in customer feedback
- Inform solution direction

## Five Evidence Sources

### 1. Social Media Listening

**What to look for:**
- Customer complaints and frustrations about current solutions
- Feature requests and wishlist items
- Workarounds people have created
- Communities and discussions around the problem space
- Influencer perspectives and trending topics

**Where to look:**
- Twitter/X (hashtags, keywords, discussions)
- Reddit (relevant subreddits, search posts)
- LinkedIn (professional perspectives, B2B insights)
- Facebook Groups (community discussions, recommendations)
- Instagram (visual evidence, lifestyle context)
- TikTok (how people actually use things, hacks)
- YouTube (reviews, tutorials, complaints)
- Local/regional platforms (WeChat, WhatsApp groups, Telegram, local forums)

**Questions to explore:**
- What are people complaining about?
- What workarounds have they invented?
- What language do they use to describe the problem?
- Who are the influential voices?
- What solutions get recommended?

### 2. Market & Competitor Analysis

**What to examine:**
- Existing solutions (direct and indirect competitors)
- Product reviews and ratings
- Feature comparisons
- Pricing models and strategies
- Go-to-market approaches
- Success stories and failures

**Where to look:**
- Product Hunt (new products, launches)
- App stores (reviews, ratings, feature lists)
- G2, Capterra (B2B software reviews)
- Amazon reviews (product feedback)
- Company websites and marketing materials
- Funding announcements (Crunchbase, TechCrunch)
- Industry reports and analyst perspectives

**Questions to explore:**
- What exists already? Who are the players?
- What do customers love? What do they hate?
- Where are the gaps in current offerings?
- What pricing are customers willing to pay?
- How saturated is the market?
- What recent trends or shifts have occurred?

### 3. Customer Feedback & Support Data

**What to analyze:**
- Support tickets and common issues
- Feature requests and product feedback
- User interviews and surveys
- Usability test results
- Churn reasons and exit interviews
- NPS scores and verbatim comments

**Where to find it:**
- Your own customer data (if you have it)
- Public forums where customers discuss products
- Review sites with detailed feedback
- User research repositories
- Customer advisory board insights
- Sales team feedback

**Questions to explore:**
- What problems come up repeatedly?
- What features do users request most?
- Why do customers leave competitors?
- What moments delight vs. frustrate?
- What use cases weren't anticipated?

### 4. Technology & Trend Scanning

**What to track:**
- Emerging technologies that enable new solutions
- Platform shifts (mobile-first, AI, blockchain, etc.)
- Regulatory changes affecting the space
- Cultural/societal trends
- Economic factors and market dynamics
- Infrastructure developments

**Where to look:**
- Tech news (TechCrunch, The Verge, Wired)
- Academic research (Google Scholar, arxiv)
- Industry conferences and reports
- Government/regulatory announcements
- Trend reports (McKinsey, Gartner, Forrester)
- Innovation showcases and accelerators

**Questions to explore:**
- What's now possible that wasn't before?
- What constraints are being removed?
- What's the "why now" for this solution?
- What tailwinds or headwinds exist?
- What adjacent spaces provide inspiration?

### 5. Direct Customer Research

**What to conduct:**
- User interviews (1-on-1 conversations)
- Contextual inquiry (observe in natural environment)
- Surveys (quantitative validation)
- Focus groups (group dynamics and discussion)
- Diary studies (track over time)
- Beta testing and feedback

**How to approach:**
- Recruit personas that match your target
- Ask about jobs, pains, and current solutions
- Observe actual behavior (not just what they say)
- Test assumptions and hypotheses
- Validate findings from other sources
- Iterate based on learning

**Questions to explore:**
- How do they currently solve this job?
- What's the sequence of steps they take?
- What emotions do they experience?
- What do they wish existed?
- What would they pay for a solution?

## Evidence Gathering Workflow

### 1. Define Research Questions
Based on JTBD and persona, identify what you need to learn:
- Validation questions: "Is this pain real and widespread?"
- Discovery questions: "What else should we know?"
- Solution questions: "What's already been tried?"

### 2. Select Evidence Sources
Choose 2-4 sources most relevant to your context:
- B2C consumer products → Social media + App reviews + Customer research
- B2B enterprise → LinkedIn + G2 reviews + Customer interviews
- Emerging markets → Local platforms + Direct research (social listening may be limited)
- Hardware/physical → Amazon reviews + YouTube + Observation

### 3. Gather & Synthesize
- Spend 3-5 hours on evidence gathering (not weeks)
- Look for patterns, not comprehensive coverage
- Capture direct quotes and specific examples
- Note contradictions and edge cases
- Identify strongest signals

### 4. Organize Findings
Structure evidence into categories:

**Validation:**
- Confirms: [What validated your assumptions]
- Contradicts: [What surprised you or contradicted expectations]

**Landscape:**
- Existing solutions: [What's out there, who's doing it]
- Gaps & opportunities: [What's missing, underserved segments]

**Customer Voice:**
- Key quotes: [Direct customer language]
- Pain intensity: [How urgent/frequent is the problem]
- Willingness to pay: [Pricing signals]

**Trends & Context:**
- Enabling factors: [What's making this possible now]
- Headwinds: [What makes this harder]

## Tips for Effective Evidence Gathering

**Do:**
- Focus on recent evidence (last 6-12 months)
- Look for patterns across multiple sources
- Capture customer language and quotes
- Consider global context (solutions vary by market)
- Balance online and offline evidence
- Note what's NOT being said (silent needs)

**Don't:**
- Spend weeks researching (diminishing returns)
- Only look at successful solutions (failures teach too)
- Ignore contradictory evidence (it reveals complexity)
- Assume Western markets represent global reality
- Rely only on one type of evidence
- Skip this step (assumptions are dangerous)

## Common Pitfalls

**Analysis paralysis:** Set time limit (3-5 hours), then synthesize
**Confirmation bias:** Actively seek contradicting evidence
**Surface-level:** Go deeper than just feature lists—understand why
**Western bias:** Include evidence from target markets, not just US/Europe
**Recency bias:** Look at sustained patterns, not just latest buzz

## Output

After evidence gathering, you should have:
1. Validated (or refined) your JTBD and persona
2. Clear picture of competitive landscape
3. Identified gaps and opportunities
4. Customer language and quotes
5. Pricing and monetization signals
6. Understanding of "why now"

This evidence informs the next phase: defining your solution direction.
