## Current Skills (Phase 1-3 Complete)

### Phase 1: Customer Discovery
**Skill:** `customer-discovery`

Deep customer understanding before defining solutions.

**What it does:**
- Jobs-to-be-Done analysis (functional, emotional, social jobs + pains & gains)
- Globally diverse persona creation (rotate through Asia-Pacific, Africa, Latin America, Middle East, Europe, North America)
- Evidence gathering from social media, market research, customer feedback, trends, direct research

**Output:** JTBD + Persona + Evidence → Foundation for solution definition

**Time:** 4-8 hours

---

### Phase 2: Solution Definition
**Skill:** `solution-definition`

Define clear solution vision and map available resources.

**What it does:**
1. **Working Backwards** - Amazon PRFAQ methodology
   - 7-paragraph press release structure
   - Customer testimonial anatomy (frustration → discovery → benefits → delightful moment → transformation → advocacy)
   - Customer FAQs + Stakeholder FAQs
2. **Closed World Mapping** - SIT principle
   - Internal components (8-15): what IS the product
   - External components (5-10): what INTERACTS with product
   - Key relationships and constraints

**Output:** Compelling PRFAQ + Complete resource inventory → Foundation for ideation

**Time:** 3-6 hours

---

### Phase 3: Ideation Powerhouse (SCAMPER)
**8 skills for systematic creative ideation**

#### Orchestrator
**Skill:** `ideation-scamper`

Guides you through all 7 SCAMPER techniques systematically to generate 30-50+ ideas.

**Time:** 60-90 minutes for full session

#### Individual SCAMPER Techniques
Use standalone for focused exploration or as part of orchestrated session:

1. **`scamper-substitute`** - Replace components with alternatives
   - Materials, technology, processes, roles, channels, business models
   - Example: Replace credit score with merchant trust score

2. **`scamper-combine`** - Merge components in novel ways
   - Features, services, data, processes, roles, purposes
   - Example: Combine loan with business training

3. **`scamper-adapt`** - Borrow from other contexts
   - Cross-industry, biomimicry, cross-cultural, historical, scale transfer
   - Example: Adapt "buy now, pay later" from e-commerce to market lending

4. **`scamper-modify`** - Change attributes, scale, or properties
   - Magnify/minify, speed changes, frequency, strength, form, flexibility
   - Example: Magnify repayment frequency from monthly to daily

5. **`scamper-put-to-other-uses`** - Repurpose components
   - New users, new problems, new contexts, waste-to-value, secondary→primary
   - Example: Use transaction analysis for business insights, not just credit scoring

6. **`scamper-eliminate`** - Remove components to simplify
   - Features, process steps, requirements, intermediaries, choices, time
   - Example: Eliminate smartphone app entirely, use SMS/USSD only

7. **`scamper-reverse`** - Flip or reorder processes/relationships
   - Process order, roles, direction, timing, ownership, information flow, power
   - Example: Reverse pricing—borrowers propose interest rate, lenders compete

**Output:** 30-50+ diverse ideas across 7 creative thinking techniques → Ready for evaluation

**Time:** 8-12 minutes per technique, 60-90 minutes total

## Coming Soon (Phase 4-6)

### Phase 4: Idea Evaluation
**Skill:** `idea-evaluation` (Planned)

Multi-criteria evaluation framework to rate and rank ideas.

- Customer value, feasibility, viability, desirability, strategic fit
- Weighted scoring with customizable criteria
- Output: Top 3-5 ideas for deep validation

### Phase 5: Critical Validation
**Skill:** `critical-validation` (Planned)

Six Thinking Hats deep-dive validation sequence.

- White (facts) → Red (emotions) → Yellow (benefits) → Black (risks) → Green (solutions) → Blue (decision) → Red (final check)
- Go/no-go/iterate decisions
- Output: Validated ideas ready for implementation

### Phase 6: Technical Breakthrough
**Skill:** `technical-breakthrough` (Planned)

TRIZ for solving hard technical problems and contradictions.

- Top 20 inventive principles
- Contradiction matrix (physical vs technical)
- Called when Black Hat validation identifies hard challenges

---

## Design Principles

### 1. Global Diversity by Default
- Examples rotate through different geographies
- Cultural context always considered
- Avoid Western/US bias

**Example personas:** Chidinma (Nigeria market trader), Mei Lin (Singapore engineering manager), Rajesh (India rural shopkeeper), Anna (Sweden logistics manager)

### 2. Connected Journey
- Each skill builds on previous outputs
- Clear handoff points between phases
- Consistent example cases across skills

**Core examples:** FairCredit (Nigeria fintech), AsyncFlow (SE Asia SaaS), SolarSeva (India solar), Unbroken (Sweden logistics)

### 3. Standalone + Orchestrated
- Skills work standalone for experienced users
- Can be orchestrated in sequence for complete journey
- Clear entry/exit points

### 4. Rich Examples
- Minimum 3-4 complete worked examples per skill
- Diverse domains (B2C/B2B, digital/physical, different industries)
- Show both successful application AND common pitfalls

### 5. Actionable Templates
- Every skill includes ready-to-use templates
- Clear output format specifications
- Integration guidance with previous/next phases
