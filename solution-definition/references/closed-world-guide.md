# Closed World Component Mapping

## Overview

The Closed World principle from Systematic Inventive Thinking (SIT) states: **solve problems using only resources already present in the system or its immediate environment**. This constraint forces creative thinking and leads to elegant, efficient innovations.

## Why Map the Closed World?

1. **Identifies all available resources** for innovation
2. **Prevents premature addition** of new components
3. **Reveals unexpected combinations** and relationships
4. **Focuses creativity** within realistic constraints
5. **Leads to simpler, cheaper solutions**

## Two Types of Components

### Internal Components
Elements that are inherently part of the product or system itself.

**Characteristics:**
- Physically part of the product/system
- Under direct control
- Can be modified, removed, or recombined
- Part of the Bill of Materials or system architecture

**Questions to identify:**
- What physical parts make up the product?
- What materials or substances are used?
- What structural elements exist?
- What features or functions are built in?
- What spaces or voids exist within?

### External Components
Elements in the immediate environment that regularly interact with or surround the system.

**Characteristics:**
- Not part of the product itself
- Present in the usage context
- Interact with or surround the product
- Consistently available during use

**Questions to identify:**
- What does the product touch or sit on?
- What enters or exits the product?
- Who interacts with the product? (users, maintenance people)
- What environmental factors are always present? (gravity, air, temperature, light)
- What accessories or complementary products are typically present?
- What waste or byproducts are generated?

## External vs. Out of Scope

**Include as External:**
- User's hands, body, clothing
- Surfaces the product rests on
- Contents (liquid in a cup, data in a drive)
- Ambient conditions (air, temperature, light)
- Energy sources typically present

**Exclude (Out of Scope):**
- Completely new elements not in current system
- Occasional accessories not regularly present
- Distant environmental factors
- Abstract concepts without physical presence

## Component Mapping Process

### Step 1: Define System Boundaries
Be clear about what you're analyzing:
- A specific product (e.g., "a smartphone")
- A service experience (e.g., "ordering food delivery")
- A system (e.g., "home heating system")

### Step 2: List Internal Components
Work systematically through the product/system:
1. Major structural elements
2. Functional components
3. Materials and substances
4. Spaces and voids
5. Features and controls

Aim for 8-15 internal components. Too few limits creativity; too many becomes unwieldy.

### Step 3: List External Components
Consider the usage environment:
1. Users and their attributes
2. Physical environment
3. Contents and inputs
4. Energy and forces
5. Outputs and waste
6. Adjacent objects

Aim for 5-10 external components most relevant to the system's function.

### Step 4: Note Key Relationships
For each component, briefly note:
- What it connects to
- What it enables or constrains
- Any special properties

## Examples

### Example 1: Coffee Cup

**Internal Components:**
- Cup body
- Handle
- Rim
- Base
- Inner surface
- Outer surface
- Material (ceramic, plastic, etc.)
- Hollow space inside

**External Components:**
- Liquid contents (coffee, tea, water)
- User's hand
- User's lips/mouth
- Table or surface it rests on
- Air above the liquid
- Ambient temperature
- Steam/heat from liquid

**Key relationships:**
- Handle connects user's hand to cup body
- Rim contacts user's lips
- Material properties affect heat transfer
- Air space above liquid enables heat loss

### Example 2: Smartphone

**Internal Components:**
- Screen/display
- Battery
- Processor/memory
- Camera(s)
- Speakers
- Microphone
- Housing/case
- Buttons
- Antenna
- Charging port
- Sensors (accelerometer, GPS, etc.)

**External Components:**
- User's hands and fingers
- User's face/ear (during calls)
- Pockets/bags (storage)
- Charging cable and power source
- Air (for cooling, sound transmission)
- Light (for screen visibility, camera)
- Surfaces (tables, desks)
- Network signals (wifi, cellular)

### Example 3: Online Meal Planning Service

**Internal Components:**
- Recipe database
- Meal planning algorithm
- User interface (web/app)
- Shopping list generator
- User profile data
- Dietary preferences settings
- Nutritional calculator
- Search function
- Save/favorite feature

**External Components:**
- User's kitchen equipment
- User's dietary restrictions
- User's schedule
- Available grocery stores
- Family members/household
- Seasonal ingredients
- User's cooking skill level
- Food already in user's pantry

## Using the Closed World for Innovation

Once mapped, the Closed World becomes the foundation for:

1. **Subtraction:** Remove an internal component—how could the system still function?
2. **Multiplication:** Duplicate a component—what new uses emerge?
3. **Division:** Split a component—what new configurations are possible?
4. **Task Unification:** Assign a new job to an existing component
5. **Attribute Dependency:** Create relationships between component attributes

The innovation techniques (SCAMPER, SIT templates) all work within this Closed World framework.
